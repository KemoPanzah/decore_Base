decore Base | UI fastly
=======================
Introduction
------------
decore Base is an out-of-the-box "Python to Vue.js" data application dashboard that helps you go from idea to view in a few simple steps. It is aimed at those who want to focus on the results of their algorithms, do scientific work or perform teaching and learning functions.

Notes
-----
**decore Base is currently a work in progress, only locally deployable, only available for Windows and not yet production ready**.

The recommended IDE is Visual Studio Code and all my comments and documentation here will also refer to vscode only.
