# decore Base | crafting UI simply
decore Base is an out-of-the-box "Python to Vue.js" data application dashboard that helps you go from idea to view in a few simple steps. It is aimed at those who want to focus on the results of their algorithms , do scientific work, or perform teaching or learning functions.

# decore Base | open source on github
decore Base is now available on github. 

Still very incomplete but to better visualize the running process I decided to publish the code on github.

The documentation is not yet complete and will be expanded over time. 

To install the sample application, please check the documentation, maybe there are already problems or ambiguities at this point.

# decore Base | Twitter sponsoring
In order to move my milestones forward with Twitter sponsorship, I desperately need support on Ko-fi.

Twitter sponsorship helps me as a newbie to get a social reach.

I hope to get feature requests or problem sets quickly to improve decore base.

# decore Base | Release 0.0.14
