# decore Base | crafting UI simply

# decore Base | open source on github

decore Base is now available on github. 

Still very incomplete but to better visualize the running process I decided to publish the code on github.

The documentation is not yet complete and will be expanded over time. 

To install the sample application, please check the documentation, maybe there are already problems or ambiguities at this point.

Documentation:

I ask for feedback and criticism. Please use the issues section in the repository.

Please don't be shy, write me in the issues what you don't like or what you don't understand. I am grateful for any criticism.

For the project status I use the project view of github.

# decore Base | Twitter sponsoring
In order to move my milestones forward with Twitter sponsorship, I desperately need support on Ko-fi.

Twitter sponsorship helps me as a newbie to get a social reach.

I hope to get feature requests or problem sets quickly to improve decore base.
